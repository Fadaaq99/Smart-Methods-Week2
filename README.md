# Smart-Methods-Week2
ESP32 Algorithms:

1/ Install Arduino App from the Link "https://www.arduino.cc/en/software"

2/ Arduino IDE We click on "File" then "Preferences" 

3/ Copy This link "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json" 
and paste it on "Additional Board Manager URLs" field then press "OK"

4/ Then We click on "Tools">>"Board" then "Board Manager" 

5/ In "Board Manager" window we search on "ESP32" it will appear in the search list "esp32 by Espressif Systems" then click install

6/ Afer few minutes of installing we click on close

7/ Back to Arduino IDE and we go to "Tools" then "Board"

8/ We go to Board list and select "ESP32 Arduino" then "WEMOS D1 MINI ESP32"

9/ We connect the "ESP32" device to the computer

10/ Back to Arduino IDE and select "Tools" then "Port"

Hint*>> If we couldn't select it we try to connect the ESP32 again to the computer or checking the ESP32 device

11/ After that if we found the port you have then it would be like "COM4"

12/ If we want to check the device that is not suspended 

14/ Back to Arduino IDE we go to "File" and select "Examples"

15/ After that in Examples list we select "Basic" then "Blink"

16/ We see that the ESP32 device linked with LED LIGHT to check that is not suspended on the Blink code  

17/ We can manipulate the speed of LED Light code whether you want it fast or slow signal

18/ Last but not least, We select on upload icon to execute the code on The ESP32 device
